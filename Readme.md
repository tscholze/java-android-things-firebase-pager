# Firebase Cloud Messaging / Android Things Pager

My sample of an [Android Things](https://developer.android.com/things/index.html) app, that will display a Google [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) (FCM) notification on an alphanumeric segment display ([Rainbow HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things)) as scrolling text (marquee). Written by a guy that's not that into Android development and pattern, yet.

### Prerequisites

* Android Things Developer Preivrew 6 or higher
* Raspberry Pi Rainbow HAT
* Firebase account

### Scheme

A FCM notification will be send to the registered Android Things app. The app receive it and will route the contained information via internal intent broadcasts to the `MainActivity`. The activity will display the text on the display by using Runnables.

## Contributing

This is a one-time-example, there will be no further development (maybe platform verison bumps fixes). That means, no contribution is necessary.
